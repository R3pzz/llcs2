# Low-Level Counter-Strike2

A research project aimed for expanding our knowlege about the all-new Counter-Strike2.

# Features

Current aim is to bring the Source2's Schema System to life.
Many more features are to be added in the future.

# Plans

Main goal is to try and implement the functionality we have in the payware for the Counter-String Global Offensive.
Apart from that, I'd also like to try and exploit some of the brand-new engine features.
